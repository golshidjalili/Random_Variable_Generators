# Random Variable Generator
## Introduction
In order to simulate many real-world problems, after fitting a probability distribution to a sequence of numbers, there is a need to artificially generate variables (called pseudo-random variables) that come from that specific distribution.
## Poisson
Poisson distribution is a famous discrete probability distribution mostly used to fit
data of number of arrivals of customers in a system (e.g., number of customers who
arrive in a bank in one hour). This distribution is defined by a parameter called rate
of arrival (alpha).
## Exponential
Exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution function mostly
used to fit data of inter-arrival times (e.g., the amount of time it takes for the next
customer to arrive at a bank). This distribution is defined by a parameter called rate
of arrival (ùõºlpha).
## Triangular
Triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution function used to fit
data with bounded values (i.e., values with known minimum, maximum and mean).
This distribution is characterized by three parameters:
1. Minimum (a)
2. Mean (b)
3. Maximum (c)
